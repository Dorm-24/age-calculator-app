## Overview

### The Challenge

Users can:

- View their age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is left empty on submission
  - The day is not between 1–31
  - The month is not between 1–12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid (e.g., 31/04/1991, since April has only 30 days)
- Experience a responsive layout optimized for any device
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements
- **Bonus:** Watch the age numbers animate to their final values when the form is submitted
